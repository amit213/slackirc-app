## Containerized Slack-IRC bridge module

### What does this do?

You're a heavy or a casual IRC user. However, lack of a good native smart-phone app for IRC (i.e. IRC client) compels you look for solution(s). Here is a solution that will likely work for you.

Get yourself a free Slack account [here](https://slack.com/), and download the native app for your smartphone ([IOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slack-team-communication/id618783545?mt=8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Slack%20Technologies%20Inc.&hl=en)).

Use this bridge module, and now your native Slack app is your always-on offline-capable search-history-capable IRC client. Rejoice.
